# Activity 1 — Agent Dialogue with KQML & KIF

**Activity Type:** Practical (Agent Communication)  
**Theme/Topic:** KQML performatives with KIF content for warehouse querying  
**Related Learning Outcomes:**  
- Understand motivations for—and appropriate use of—agent-based computing.  
- Understand main agent models and their grounding in AI research.

## Summary of Activity
I implemented a short dialogue between **Alice** (procurement) and **Bob** (warehouse) using **KQML** performatives with **KIF** content. Alice queried (i) available stock of 50-inch televisions and (ii) the number of HDMI slots. Bob replied with `tell` messages carrying bindings (e.g., `(= ?qty 42)`). The example separates protocol (KQML) from semantics (KIF) and demonstrates intent-centric messaging for interoperable multi-agent systems.

## Key Concepts & Insights
- **Protocol vs. semantics:** KQML handles *how* agents talk; KIF captures *what* they assert.  
- **Ontology hygiene:** agreeing on symbols like `tv-50-inch` and `hdmi-slots` avoids drift.  
- **Testable pairs:** compact **ask-one / tell** exchanges validate messaging and KB consistency.

## Critical Reflection
Defining precise KIF predicates reduced ambiguity in replies. Next, I’d add error paths (unknown item, unit mismatch) and negotiation for alternatives when stock is low.
