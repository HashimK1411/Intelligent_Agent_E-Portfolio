# Academic Research Online Agent ‚Äì Project Highlights

## üß† Overview
The *Academic Research Online Agent* proposal outlines a **multi-agent system** designed to automate the retrieval of academic literature from trusted sources like **arXiv, Crossref, and DOAJ**.  
It aims to reduce manual workload in academic research by providing structured, reproducible, and ethically sourced data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Design Features
- **Architecture:** API-first, multi-agent system featuring **Discovery**, **Fetch**, **Extract**, **Storage**, and **Coordinator** agents.  
- **Model:** Built around the **Belief‚ÄìDesire‚ÄìIntention (BDI)** framework for autonomy, reactivity, proactivity, and cooperation.  
- **Technologies:** Python 3.10+, using libraries such as `requests`, `json`, `csv`, and `argparse`.  
- **Functionality:**  
  - Converts user queries into structured API requests.  
  - Normalises metadata (DOI/arXiv ID).  
  - Exports results as CSV and presents them on an HTML results page.  
- **System Qualities:** Portable, reproducible, modular, and aligned with ethical API usage standards.  
- **Challenges Addressed:** Data heterogeneity, duplication, API rate limits, and agent coordination through retry and fallback mechanisms.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Personal Contribution
You **actively assisted throughout the project‚Äôs lifecycle**, including:  
- **Brainstorming sessions:** Contributed to defining the system scope, user needs, and architectural approach.  
- **User scenario creation:** Helped formulate realistic and diverse scenarios (Annex A & B) to validate agent functions.  
- **Report writing:** Collaborated in drafting and refining sections such as the introduction, design decisions, and critical discussion to ensure academic clarity and cohesion.  

Your input strengthened the theoretical grounding (BDI model integration) and ensured user-focused scenario alignment across the agent‚Äôs components.
