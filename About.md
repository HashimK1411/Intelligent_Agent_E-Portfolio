# About Me

My name is Hashim Korimbocus, and I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Essex. I hold a BSc in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics and work as a Cybersecurity Analyst. My academic and professional background reflects a strong interest in the intersection of data, security, and intelligent systems.

One of my main goals during this programme is to learn and master the core fundamentals of intelligent agents. Through this module, I aimed to strengthen my technical abilities while critically engaging with the ethical and professional challenges of intelligent agents. I’m passionate about using AI not just to solve problems, but to do so ethically with fairness, security, and transparency at the core.
